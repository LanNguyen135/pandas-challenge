This repository contains the code and data for an analysis of student performance in the district. The analysis was performed using Python and the Pandas library within a Jupyter Notebook.

### Overview
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the educational performance of schools in the district and explore factors that may influence student achievement. The analysis is based on two datasets: one containing information on schools, their sizes, and budgets, and the other containing data on student performance, including math and reading grades.

### Analysis Steps

- Data Loading: Load the school and student data from the provided CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.

- District and School Summary: Calculate the total number of schools, students, and the district's budget. Compute the average math and reading scores of students.

- Highest and Lowest Performing Schools: Identify the top 5 highest performing schools and the bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rates.

- Comparison of Scores Across Grades: Analyze student scores in math and reading across different grade levels to identify trends.

- Impact of School Spending: Investigate the relationship between school spending per student and student achievement.

- Influence of School Size: Examine the impact of school size on student performance.

- Sccores by School Type: Compare the performance of charter schools and district schools.

### Results and Findings

The analysis provides insights into the district's educational performance and reveals the following key findings:

- Student scores remain consistent across grade levels, indicating stable academic progress.

- Surprisingly, schools with lower spending per student demonstrate higher average scores, warranting further investigation.

- Smaller schools have an advantage in student performance, suggesting the benefits of personalized attention.

- Charter schools outperform district schools, potentially due to greater autonomy and flexibility.
